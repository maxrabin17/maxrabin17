### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I'm Max from New York, and I am a recent graduate from Flatiron School's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I have background experience in customer service, including food runnimg, waitering, and bar-backing. I really enjoy learning and working with Front-End languages such as JavaScript and React.js. I also enjoy wireframing projects using tools like Figma with my desktop, and Mockup with my iPad.
